# v2.13 to 2.14

## Avoid v2.14.0 manifests and use v2.14.1

The tagged v2.14.0 manifests contain a nonexistent Argo CD image. If you are using the Argo CD manifests as a remote
base, use the v2.14.1 manifests instead.

Eg, `https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/manifests/ha/cluster-install?ref=v2.14.1` or
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.14.1/manifests/install.yaml`

## Upgraded Helm Version

Helm was upgraded to 3.16.2 and the skipSchemaValidation Flag was added to
the [CLI and Application CR](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation). 

## New `argocd app health-check` command

A new `argocd app health-check` command has been introduced, providing comprehensive health monitoring capabilities for applications. This command offers detailed health information beyond basic status checks, including application sync status, resource health, pod readiness, service connectivity, and resource drift detection.

Example usage:
```bash
# Basic health check
argocd app health-check guestbook

# Continuous health monitoring
argocd app health-check guestbook --continuous --interval 30

# Health check with JSON output  
argocd app health-check guestbook -o json
```

## Breaking Changes

## Sanitized project API response

Due to security reasons ([GHSA-786q-9hcg-v9ff](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-786q-9hcg-v9ff)),
the project API response was sanitized to remove sensitive information. This includes
credentials of project-scoped repositories and clusters.
